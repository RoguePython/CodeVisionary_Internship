            <h1>About Me</h1> <br> <br>
            Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Benjamin, and I am an aspiring IT professional from Bloemfontein with a strong passion for technology and programming. I have recently completed my National Senior Certificate at Jim Fouchè Hoërskool, 
            where I developed a robust foundation in Computer Applications Technology and Information Technology. My dedication and proficiency in these subjects were reflected in my achievements, having attained the highest marks in Computer Applications 
            Technology in 2021 and the second highest in 2022.<br><br>  

            Currently, I hold the position of General Manager at Dancakes Coffee & Bakery. This role has been instrumental in shaping my leadership and organizational skills, as I am responsible for overseeing daily operations, managing multiple locations,
            and ensuring seamless service delivery. One of my most notable achievements in this role was successfully managing our stall independentsly on several occasions, demonstrating my problem-solving abilities and resilience.<br><br>  
                
            In addition to my technical expertise, I pride myself on being an ethical person with integrity, qualities that my current employer recognized when entrusting me with significant responsibilities. I possess exceptional communication and time management skills, 
            and I am committed to delivering high-quality work.<br><br>  
                
            My short-term goal is to secure a position in the IT industry where I can refresh and further develop my coding skills. In the long term, I aspire to advance within a company that values dedication and hard work, showcasing my abilities and
            contributing to innovative projects.<br><br>  
                
            Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I am excited about the opportunities ahead and look forward to contributing my skills and passion to a dynamic IT team. Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch if you have any questions or collaboration ideas.<br><br>
